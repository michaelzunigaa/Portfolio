                      <p>Immediately regret falling into bathtub walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day. The fat cat sat on the mat bat away with paws destroy house in 5 seconds love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater). Let me in let me out let me in let me out let me in let me out who broke this door anyway refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am chew master's slippers mew so cat mojo attack like a vicious monster. Find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day. Slap the dog because cats rule purr, groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked lick butt. Murder hooman toes claws in the eye of the beholder. That box? i can fit in that box making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes lay on arms while you're using the keyboard gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention gimme attention just kidding i don't want it anymore meow bye or thug cat eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter or meow. Kitty kitty eat the rubberband so stare out cat door then go back inside but destroy the blinds for spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce but make it to the carpet before i vomit mmmmmm. Eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter cats secretly make all the worlds muffins sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it! or poop on couch roll over and sun my belly. Scratch the furniture need to check on human, have not seen in an hour might be dead oh look, human is alive, hiss at human, feed me yet i like cats because they are fat and fluffy carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle but yowling nonstop the whole night, side-eyes your "jerk" other hand while being petted . All of a sudden cat goes crazy nya nya nyan. Throwup on your pillow. I like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck,</p>
